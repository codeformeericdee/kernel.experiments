___ What is this file called Bootloader without any .exe looking extensions? ___

This file has no extension, because it is a binary file.

Binary files can be booted by the computer. In some cases you might see a .bin, or a .flp extension being loaded
into Bochs or QEMU as the Floppy.

If you would like to learn how to use Bochs and QEMU, I left a tutorial on how to do that in in this folder: {/OS24 Repository/QA}.
