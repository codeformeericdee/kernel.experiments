___ What is this file? ___

It runs Bochs using your specified settings. Specifically, it is set to use 1.2 inch floppy emulation.
In order to make this work on your computer, you first need to install Bochs from their website: https://bochs.sourceforge.io/
I'm using bochs-2.7.pre1 release at the time of this writing. I kept an installer for you in the QA folder in this repository.
Then you need to change the file setup (path) in the line that I highlighted below.
After that, you can just double click on the bochsrc.bxrc icon and it will start the file from your saved folder path.

Making it into a hotkey shortcut:
Right click and select create shortcut. Then place that shortcut on your desktop, right click the shortcut, select properties, and set a hotkey to start it with.

___ Change this file setup path to the file location of your Bootloader file either without any extension, or with .bin or .flp ___

floppya: type=1_2, 1_2="C:\Eric's Folders\Development\Assembly\OS24\OS24 Repository\Build\Outputs\FloppyFormat\Bootloader", status=inserted, write_protected=0

___ You need to change this in the bochsrc.bxrc file though, not this one. This one is just an instructive example ___
